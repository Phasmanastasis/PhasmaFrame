# Git / Linear Development Workflow

This is a binding, repository-wide rule. It applies to **every** feature that Kiro
implements, modifies, or proposes — whether the work is done by Kiro or a human
developer. Kiro's responsibility is to keep work tracked in Linear and structured
through an issue-specific branch and pull request. The human developer retains
final review and merge authority.

Follow this workflow whenever a change qualifies as a **new feature** (new
functionality, a user-facing behavior change, or a non-trivial enhancement). Pure
no-op questions, read-only analysis, and trivial local edits that the user did not
ask to ship do not require an issue, but any work intended to land in the codebase
does.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **One feature per branch, PR, and Linear task.** Every feature gets its own Linear
  task, its own branch, and its own pull request. Do not bundle unrelated features into
  one branch or one PR, and do not reuse a single branch for multiple features. If a
  request contains several features, split them into separate tasks/branches/PRs and
  state any dependencies between them.
- **NEVER MERGE the feature PR.** Do not run `git merge`, `gh pr merge`, or any
  equivalent merge operation. Do not enable auto-merge. Do not squash/rebase-and-merge
  through GitHub on the team's behalf. Do not close the PR merely because
  implementation is complete. The developer/reviewer performs the final review and
  merge manually. Treat this as an absolute rule with no exceptions.
- **Never invent values.** Never fabricate a Linear issue, assignee, repository,
  branch, fork, or PR target. If the correct value cannot be determined from project
  configuration or existing conventions, ask the user instead of guessing.
- **Prefer existing over new.** Always prefer an existing Linear issue over creating a
  duplicate, and an existing fork/branch over creating a duplicate.
- **Preserve existing conventions.** When the project's Git or Linear conventions
  differ from the generic defaults below, follow the project's conventions.

## Workflow

### 1. Ensure a Linear issue exists (before any implementation)

Every new feature MUST have a corresponding Linear issue before implementation begins.

- First search Linear (via the Linear MCP integration) for an existing issue that
  already covers the feature. Reuse it if found. Do not create duplicates.
- If no suitable issue exists, create one in Linear via the Linear MCP integration.
  The issue MUST clearly describe:
  - the feature,
  - its purpose,
  - its scope, and
  - acceptance criteria.
- Assign the issue to the developer responsible for the work. Use the repository/team's
  existing developer identity when it is unambiguous; otherwise ask for the correct
  assignee rather than guessing.

### 2. Link all implementation work to the Linear issue

- Use the Linear issue identifier in the Git branch name and in the pull request title.
- Keep commits and the PR description clearly associated with the issue.

### 3. Create or reuse the appropriate branch/fork

Before implementing, set up the working branch according to the repository's existing
collaboration workflow.

- If the project uses GitHub forks, work from the developer's fork rather than modifying
  the upstream repository directly.
- If a suitable fork already exists, reuse it. Do not create unnecessary duplicate forks.
- Name the branch using the Linear issue identifier. This repository's convention is
  `jeremyviengarriola/phasm-NN-slug` (e.g., `jeremyviengarriola/phasm-32-workflow-rule`),
  matching Linear's generated branch names. One branch serves exactly one issue.

### 4. Implement on the issue-specific branch

- Follow the repository's existing coding, testing, formatting, and review conventions.
- Run the relevant tests/checks before opening the pull request.
- Do not make unrelated changes.

### 5. Open a pull request (do not merge)

When implementation is complete, open a PR from the issue-specific branch to the
appropriate upstream/base branch.

- The PR title MUST reference the Linear issue identifier.
- The PR description MUST link to the Linear issue and summarize the implementation,
  the tests performed, and any notable decisions.
- Create the PR with the appropriate CLI (e.g., `gh pr create`). **Do not merge it.**

### 6. Report back

After opening the PR, report:

- Linear issue identifier and URL
- branch name
- fork/repository used
- PR URL
- tests/checks performed
- any remaining caveats or decisions requiring developer review

## Branch, PR, and scope conventions

These conventions apply to every feature, in addition to the workflow steps above.

- **Branch naming.** Use `jeremyviengarriola/phasm-NN-slug`, matching Linear's generated
  branch name for the issue. One branch maps to exactly one Linear issue.
- **PR target.** Open the PR against `master` by default, or against the specific base
  branch the requester names. Each PR links its Linear task and references the identifier
  in its title.
- **Never push directly to `master`.** All changes reach `master` only through a reviewed
  pull request. Do not commit to or push the base branch directly.
- **Never force-push a shared branch.** Do not force-push `master` or any branch others
  may have pulled. Force-pushing is only ever acceptable on your own unshared feature
  branch, and even then prefer new commits.
- **Keep diffs small and focused.** A PR changes one feature and nothing unrelated. Ship
  the feature's documentation in the same PR as the feature.
- **Stack or wait on dependencies.** When a feature depends on another unmerged feature,
  either branch it off the dependency branch and say so in the PR description, or wait for
  the dependency PR to merge first. State the choice explicitly.

## This repository's defaults

These are discovered defaults for PhasmaFrame. Verify them against live project state
before relying on them; if any value is ambiguous or has changed, ask rather than guess.

- Upstream repository: `Phasmanastasis/PhasmaFrame` (GitHub).
- Base branch for PRs: `master`.
- Local developer identity (git config): `Lyra Phasma <whinyaan@gmail.com>` — use this as
  the Linear assignee only when it unambiguously maps to the responsible developer.
- Linear integration is configured via MCP in `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (`linear` server).
- Monorepo (pnpm). Run the project's checks before opening a PR — e.g., `pnpm install`
  then the relevant build/lint/test scripts for the affected `apps/*` or `packages/*`
  workspace.
